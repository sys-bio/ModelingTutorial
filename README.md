Exporting models as SBML
A simple introduction to metabolic control analysis - Sauro
Automatically annotating models using AMAS - Woosub
Extension

Tellurium is a powerful python based platform for building, simulating and analyzing models of metabolic, signaling and gene regulatory networks. 

Tellurium can be installed on Windows OS X or Linux. Instructions can be found at: 

https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium

For Windows the easiest thing to do is use our Windows installer at:

https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium#front-end-1-spyder-for-tellurium-ide

For Mac we recommend installing python and then installing tellurium by running pip install tellurium from the Mac terminal.

Tellurium can also be run from free online services such as Googleâ€™s colaboaratory within Jupyter notebooks.
