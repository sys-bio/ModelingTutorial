MPA 2023 Workshop 2: Developing Reproducible Mechanistic Models  of Metabolism 
Presenters: Herbert Sauro  (UW, Seattle), Janis Shin (UW, Seattle), and Woosub Shin (NZ, Auckland, and UW Seattle)

The workshop will cover:

1. Short talk: What is reproducibility?  - Sauro
2. A brief discussion on potential solutions to publishing reproducible model- Sauro
3. Examples of metabolic modeling software that support reproducibly standards- Sauro (Tellurium, Iridium, Copasi)
4. Introduction to our software platform Tellurium - Sauro
5. Running Tellurium on the desktop or web- Sauro
6. [Quick way to make SBML](https://sys-bio.github.io/makesbml/)
7. Intro to Tellurium notebook - Janis
    - Writing simple metabolic models using Tellurium
    - Exporting models as SBML
    - A simple introduction to metabolic control analysis - Sauro
8. Automatically annotating models using AMAS - Woosub
9. Extension

Tellurium is a powerful python based platform for building, simulating and analyzing models of metabolic, signaling and gene regulatory networks. 

Tellurium can be installed on Windows OS X or Linux. Instructions can be found at: 

    https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium

For Windows the easiest thing to do is use our Windows installer at:

    https://github.com/sys-bio/tellurium#front-end-1-spyder-for-tellurium-ide

For Mac we recommend installing python and then installing tellurium by running pip install tellurium from the Mac terminal.

Tellurium can also be run from free online services such as Googleâ€™s colaboaratory within Jupyter notebooks.
